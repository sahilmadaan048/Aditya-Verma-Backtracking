/*

Recap of previous toopic is very important

recursion is the parent of Backtracking
thus the base conditipns we haver to write here also

generally made void

if(isSolved()) => returns true or false


no of choices in backtracking is usually large

controlled recursion

say if choice == S or W only then procees

this type of control in recusrion is usualyy seen in backtracking


pass by value/ reference is to be kept in mind while doing backtracking

void solve*&v() {

    if(issolved()) {
        print/ save
    }

    for (ch in choices) {
        if(isvalid == true){
            choice is _INLINE_VARIABLES_SUPPORTED
            solve(v)
            revert changes in v   //this is backtracking
