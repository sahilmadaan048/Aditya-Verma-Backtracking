RECURSIONS :

what is not backtracking ?
    not really what you think it is

difference between backtracking , dp, and recursion
    recursion ke hi bacche hain sab
    backtracking, DP and DnC all

Generic => in recursion you make a recursive tree and find the answer on the leaf node
        => DP => find optimal solution and gernerally find answer in the leaf node or n, n cell in the tabulation form
              => is Recursion + memory
        => BT => recursion + control  
              => they ask us find all the possible combinations, or permuations
              => path is the ans

pass by value and pass by reference
    string s = "Ab" is stored simwhere in the memory
    pass by value => another string is created when passed through a function instead of the oproginal string
            changes done to the passed strinf inside the function are not reflected in the original string

    pass by reference => reference of the same string is passed thius changes done to the passed stroing are reflecte in the original string also

BT (backtracking)  = controlled recursion +  pass by reference
    =>here we take those decisions / choices which are of befinit to us 
    =>not all of them unlike

backtracking ques can be solved by recursion only and
vice versa
